# Lab12 - 20 Questions
Partner Lab 

Find a partner to work with – if you do not want to work with a partner, you may work alone.  However, it might be less work to share the work on this one.  Let me know if you want me to assign you with a partner who would be willing to work with you.

Look at CSAwesome 3.3.2 Programming Challenge: 20 Questions
This challenge has the user think of an animal and the program asks yes-no questions to try to guess what animal the user is thinking of.
You are to modify this program.  Instead of guessing an animal, choose a movie, song, singer or athlete, etc.  Spend some time planning your questions on paper.  You must submit your decision tree written out in addition to your code.

After you have designed your decision tree, begin coding.  Hint:  Only do a few statements at a time before you enter everything!  Get a section working before expanding the code.  Remember – you can use the CSAwesome link as a starting point but you MUST use a different theme!!

- Submit your decision tree on a piece of paper or electronic version
Code Requirements-
-	Header including the names of each person who worked on the project, date, project title and project description 
-	Programming comments should be included for each logical block of code.
-	Program should ask the user to think of an <item in selected set> . (Ex.  Actor, movie, athlete, etc.)
-	The computer should ask the user a yes-no question.  The user should enter “y” or “n”.
-	Based on that prompt, the computer either follows up with another question, or makes a guess.
-	This program may continue for a few guesses.
-	Requirement – Your program should have at least **6 different results** as potential outputs.  Note, this does not mean there will always be 4 questions…Just 6 different potential outputs.
-	Output should be easy to read, with no typographical errors.

Bonus – Make the guesses case INsensitive.  That is, if the user enters a “Y” or “y” it records a yes and if the user enters a “n” or “N” it registers as a no.
